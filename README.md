# Important

This project is currently work in progress. The NuGet package is not yet available for v2. For now, you can fork this repository to try it out. [Follow @iammukeshm on X](https://x.com/iammukeshm) for project related updates.

# Quick Start Guide

As the project is still in beta, the NuGet packages are not yet available. You can try out the project by pulling the code directly from this repository.

Prerequisites:

- .NET 9 SDK installed.
- Visual Studio IDE.
- Docker Desktop.
- PostgreSQL instance running on your machine or docker container.

Please follow the below instructions.

1. Fork this repository to your local.
2. Open up the `./src/FSH.Starter.sln`.
3. This would up the FSH Starter solution which has 3 main components.
   1. Aspire Dashboard (set as the default project)
   2. Web API
   3. Blazor
4. Now we will have to set the connection string for the API. Navigate to `./src/api/server/appsettings.Development.json` and change the `ConnectionString` under `DatabaseOptions`. Save it.
5. Once that is done, run the application via Visual Studio, with Aspire as the default project. This will open up Aspire Dashboard at `https://localhost:7200/`.
6. API will be running at `https://localhost:7000/swagger/index.html`.
7. Blazor will be running at `https://localhost:7100/`.
