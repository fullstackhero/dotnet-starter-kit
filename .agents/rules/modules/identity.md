# Module: Identity

Auth (JWT + ASP.NET Identity), users, roles, permissions, sessions, impersonation, 2FA.

## Service shape

`IUserService` is a **facade** that delegates to focused single-responsibility services — change behavior in the specific service, not the facade:

| Interface | Concern |
|---|---|
| `IUserRegistrationService` | register, external-principal create, email/phone confirm |
| `IUserProfileService` | get/list/count, update profile, image, existence checks |
| `IUserStatusService` | activate/deactivate (`DeleteAsync` == deactivate), audited toggles |
| `IUserRoleService` | role assignment, admin-role guards |
| `IUserPasswordService` | forgot/reset/change password, history + expiry |
| `IUserPermissionService` | effective permissions, cache invalidation |

`ChangePassword`/`Update`/`Delete` etc. flow facade → service → EF/UserManager. `CancellationToken` is `= default` on these interfaces and propagated into EF sinks (note: `UserManager`/`RoleManager` have no CT overloads, so private helpers that only call them don't take one).

## Permission gating footgun

`RequiredPermissionAttribute` implements `FSH.Framework.Shared.Identity.Authorization.IRequiredPermissionMetadata`. **Never let a second/duplicate `IRequiredPermissionMetadata` appear** — it silently disables **all** `.RequirePermission()` gates across the app. Permission constants live in `Shared/Identity/*Permissions.cs`.

## Hosted services (background)

- `RolePermissionSyncHostedService` — best-effort sync of the permission catalog; loops, catches `Exception` *with* an `OperationCanceledException` filter, logs and continues.
- `SessionCleanupHostedService` — hourly expired-session purge; OCE handled by a preceding catch.

These are the model for background loops: stay alive, log with context, never swallow cancellation. See `api-conventions.md`.

## Tokens / sessions

Login `POST /api/v1/identity/token/issue` (header `X-FSH-App` enforces the operator/tenant app boundary). Refresh `POST /api/v1/identity/token/refresh` cross-checks subject. Session rows are written best-effort during login — failures log a warning and login still succeeds. Admin can't demote/deactivate the last admin or the root-tenant seed admin (guards in `UserRoleService`/`UserStatusService`).

## Tests

`Identity.Tests` is the largest unit suite. When asserting a forwarded `CancellationToken`, assert the specific token (see `testing.md`).
